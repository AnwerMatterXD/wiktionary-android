#summary Why don't the widgets display a pronucication key?

The most common pronuncication key is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet International Phonetic Alphabet], or IPA for short. Sites like wikipedia and wiktionary almost exclusively depend on IPA.

_The font set available on Android devices do not include the IPA glyphs._ There is an [http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3167 issue] filed against the Android core that documents the problem.

The Word of the Day Widget cannot get around this limitation. Attempts to display the IPA glyphs cause the device to render a block symbol. If you have an interest in seeing this fixed, go vote for the issue listed above.
