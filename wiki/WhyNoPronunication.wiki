#summary Why don't the widgets display a pronucication key?

The most common pronuncication key is the [International Phonetic Alphabet|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet], or IPA for short. Sites like wikipedia and wiktionary almost exclusively depend on IPA.

The fonts available on Android devices to include the IPA glyphs. There is an [issue|http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3167] filed against the Android core that documents the problem.

The Word of the Day Widget cannot get around this limitation. Attempts to display the IPA glyphs cause the device to render a block symbol. If you have an interest in seeing this fixed, go vote for the issue listed above.
